# Swing-Calendar
A remake of my old project Tkinter Calendar, in Java Swing.

## Description:
This is a simple, general use calendar. 
There are three sections: Daily Info, New Events, and Manage.
Daily Info gives you info about the date, your current and upcoming events, and holidays.
New Events allows you to create daily and weekly events.
Manage displays a list of all your events, where you can delete and edit events.
There is a settings page for different themes, and a setting for how far in the future upcoming events are shown.
More information is in the help page.

## How do I run this?
1. Compile in Eclipse.

## File Description:

`Settings Folder:` Contains the settings for the theme and days notice setting.

`Assets Folder:` Stores all the images the calendar uses.

`Events Folder:` Contains the file events.calendar, which stores all the events.

`scr Folder:` The place where all the code is.

Deleting the files in the folders or deleting the folders will break the calendar.
